# MacDisplay
~~Currently only shows a white screen~~

The example now works with several test images and every image you can imagine, as long as it is in the desired format. See the examples, if you want to display custom images.

Currently working on displaying the shell and x server output on the screen.
See http://www.nerdhut.de/ for informations, updates will be released there.
